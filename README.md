## Reflection:
The primary goal of this project was to explore factors influencing the success of U.S. halfpipe skiers, particularly focusing on optimal training environments, sponsorship opportunities, and the role of social media in supporting athletes' careers. Using data from the International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS) and various ski resort datasets, I conducted a detailed analysis of athlete performance, sponsorship trends, social media influence, and training region characteristics. After extensive data cleaning, merging, and web scraping for sponsorship and social media metrics, I created a comprehensive dataset specifically focused on U.S. halfpipe competitors.

Key findings suggest that while the Rocky Mountain region provides substantial advantages—such as consistent snowfall and challenging slopes, which make it an ideal training ground for aspiring national team athletes—the high costs associated with training there do not strongly correlate with higher performance scores. Additionally, female skiers consistently achieved higher HP points than their male counterparts but receive fewer sponsorships, underscoring ongoing gender disparities in extreme sports. A strong positive correlation between HP points and social media following highlights how high performance can lead to increased visibility and sponsorship opportunities. These insights suggest that athletes aiming to excel should prioritize quality training practices over costly locations and recognize the value of social media presence for career growth.

**This experience has been both challenging and rewarding, giving me the chance to apply a variety of technical skills while diving into a topic I’m deeply passionate about. As a lifelong fan of skiing and extreme sports, this project resonated with me on a personal level, especially when examining gender disparities in the sport. Discovering that female skiers often outperform their male peers yet receive fewer sponsorships was eye-opening; as a woman who once dreamed of competing in skiing, seeing these talented athletes excel despite the challenges reinforces my commitment to using data to spotlight and address inequalities. This project not only helped me build technical skills in data science but also allowed me to creatively present insights that reflect both the data and my love for skiing.**
